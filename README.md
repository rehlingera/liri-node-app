# liri-node-app

An app designed to make API calls for movies, songs, and concerts.

## How to use
<ol>
<li>Open up the Git Bash window and navigate to the folder containing the liri node app.</li>
<li>Type `node` to call on Node.js, then type `liri.js` to call on the liri-node-app.</li>
<li>On the same line, type one of the following commands:</li>
    <ul>
    <li>`concert-this`: This will take a band or musician name and perform a search of 20 upcoming tour dates and locations. If the band is not currently touring, the app will return "Sorry, no concert results for this band!"</li>
    <li>`spotify-this-song`: This command will take a song name, search for it on Spotify and return up to 20 results, along with the corresponding artists, the album and a link to a preview (if available).</li>
    <li>`movie-this`: This command will take a movie title and search the Open Movie Database, returning the most relevant result.</li>
    <li>`do-what-it-says`: This command will run a random command stored in the "random.txt" file and display its result.</li>
    </ul>
<li> On the same line, type your artist, band, song or movie. Names with spaces should be enclosed in double quotes (`"The Dear Hunter"` or `"The Godfather"`). This is allowed, but not necessary, for single word inputs.</li>
</ol>
